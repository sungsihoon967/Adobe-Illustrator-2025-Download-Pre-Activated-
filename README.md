The drawing program is a professional solution for designing professional vector-based illustrations for posters, business letters, business cards, brochures, websites, and menus. You can bundle and group up to 100 large drawings in a single Illustrator file.

Via a selection list, you can access the desired element directly. "Adobe Illustrator" reads all major formats such as EPS, FXG, PSD, TIFF, GIF, JPEG, SWF, SVG, DWG, or DXF. If you want to pass on your designs, "package files" offer themselves. Here, you summarize all required fonts and graphics in one folder. Alternatively, secure your print-sharing designs as multi-page PDF documents with Illustrator layers.
